        <h4>Recent Match History</h4>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;A match history would be provided to allow the player to monitor their
          performance in their most recent gaming sessions. This feature allows the player to
          reflect on how they played to in turn improve their future games. A big selling point of
          statistic websites are showing off to friends and fellow gamers. Match histories are
          perfect for recording highlight games to share afterwards.</p>
          <p>The match history will bring similar info to light as highlighted above, for example:</p>
          <div class="listCol">
              <ul>
                <li>Gamemode played</li>
                <li>Number of kills</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
        <h2 class="intro-title">Use Cases</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Bragging to one’s friends or peers is a large part in gaming culture nowadays.
            The competitive spirit within us all, desires to be better than those around us. Many
            games lack an effective way of sharing one’s achievements. Through publicizing these
            statistics, players have access to all their achievements. The internet is readily available
            in modern society, so we are able to streamline the sharing of player statistics.
          </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;With the emergence of esports culture and the rise of competition within the
            gaming environment, statistics are a good representation of a gamer’s skill. Competition
            within the scene is at an all time high with the many success stories that spawned from
            humble beginnings. For example, the growth of Twitch Streamer “Ninja” shows how skill
            within a game could translate to a large fanbase and mountain high viewership. Such
            huge successes in the industry are spawning more and more gamers who wish to strive
            for the same degree of success within their chosen videogame. We are here to provide
            a tool for these people to help them improve and display their skills through thenumbers and not only through word of mouth. Player statistics could be one’s ticket to
            recognition and a separation from the large crowd of people who make up the casual
            player base. Our service is their resume and their gateway to improvement, as they
            reflect on their past achievements and build upon their foundations.
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;We at Player’s Advantage are here for the people, but we also desire to aid the
          developers of the game and bring improvements to what is lacking. We look to publicize
          otherwise hidden statistics to bring attention to the problems within the game. Balancing
          issues plague the competitive gaming industry due to the nature of the practice and the
          almost zero chance of perfecting the art. Through analyzing the numbers, balancing
          faults could be found and possibly eased with game patches in the future.
        </p>
        <h2 class="intro-title">Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>The team at Player’s Advantage look to provide a service to compete with the
            others within the environment. We are striving to be the leading platform in our niche
            and ideally plan to expand past our focus on a single game. Our developers at Player’s
            Advantage all hold a stake within the project to motivate an approach to greatness.
            </p>
        <h2 class="intro-title">IDEO Method Research</h2>
        <p> In the document bellow are the 2 Ideo research methods we used and their results that helped lead us to the conclusions we have reached above. We chose these 2 methods because as we found out there is a range of functionality already in existence from competitors which needs refinement. </p>
